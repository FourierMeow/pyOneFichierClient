# pyOneFichierClient

This is a library designed for easy interaction with the [1Fichier API](https://1fichier.com/api.html)

## Recomendation
Do not update on Friday - Sunday because that are times when I am mainly working on this... if you do beware there can be (not that it's planned) so called forced updates which could screw up your updating...
<br />I will try to leave a message in the README (right here) whenever I do not plan on working on the API and it's okay to update it...

Until Wednesday, January 3rd 2019 it's definetly NOT okay to update it because it will be updated quite a few times until then... after.. probably not so much for a while...
